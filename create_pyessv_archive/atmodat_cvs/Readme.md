# AtMoDat_CVs

This repository contains lists of mandatory/required, recommended and optional global attributes. Controlled vocabularies (CVs) for possible values of these attributes will follow later on.

The lists/CVs are stored in JSON files. The structure is the same as of the [CMIP6_CVs](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/CMIP6_CVs/).

Work in progress
