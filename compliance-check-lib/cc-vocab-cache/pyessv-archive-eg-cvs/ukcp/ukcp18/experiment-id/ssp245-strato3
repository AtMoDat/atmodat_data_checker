In models with coupled chemistry, the chemistry scheme should be turned off, and the simulated ensemble mean monthly mean 3D stratospheric ozone concentrations from the SSP2-4.5 simulations should be prescribed. Tropospheric ozone should be fixed at 3D long-term monthly mean piControl values, with a value of 100 ppbv ozone concentration in this piControl climatology used to separate the troposphere from the stratosphere. In models without coupled chemistry the same stratospheric ozone prescribed in SSP2-4.5 should be prescribed. Stratospheric ozone concentrations will be provided by CCMI",
