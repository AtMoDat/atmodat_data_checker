    "description": "Global ocean - sea-ice coupled experiment forced with the JRA55-do inter-annually varying atmospheric and river data sets for years 1958-2018. Initial ocean tracer fields are based on observations. Simulation length for at least 6 cycles of the 61-year forcing is required. The 6-cycle length is recommended to facilitate intercomparison within the experiment by using a common simulation length, but a longer simulation length is also accepted. In each simulation, set the beginning of the simulation (e.g., 1653 for the 6-cycle simulation) as the 'base time' of the time axis. Simulations with different simulation lengths by a single model are treated as members of an ensemble. Thus, different 'realization' indexes (e.g., r1, r2, r3, ...) should be used in a global attribute named 'variant_index' (e.g., r1i1p1f1). It is requested that information relevant to understanding the differences in members of an ensemble of simulations is reported in a global attribute named 'variant_info'. This information should also be recorded in the ES-DOC documentation of each experiment performed by a model and be made available via the 'further_info_url' attribute. All Priority=1 OMIP diagnostics (Omon, Oyr) are requested for all cycles of the 61-year forcing to quantify drift. All OMIP diagnostics (Priority=1,2,3) are requested for the last cycle",
