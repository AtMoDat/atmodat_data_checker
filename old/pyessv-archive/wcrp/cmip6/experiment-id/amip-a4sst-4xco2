    "description": "Same as amip, but a patterned SST anomaly is applied on top of the monthly-varying amip SSTs. This anomaly is a monthly climatology, taken from each model's own abrupt-4xCO2 run minus piControl (using the mean of years 111-140 of abrupt-4xCO2, and the parallel 30-year section of piControl). CO2 is quadrupled, and the increase in CO2 is seen by both the radiation scheme and vegetation",
